# About Nightly branch

Nightly is the current version, but it's unfinished. I will update pattern at ant moment. Once I think it's good for publish, I will rebase nightly into master.

# About Interaction Pattern File

This file will include some useful interaction patterns for mobile design, as a interaction designer, I create those patterns just for wireframe.

But for User Interface Designer, you will notice some different between original sketch file. I use SHARED STYLE instead of TEXT STYLE to set text color, so that you could just change color in one place, and all buttons, inputs, text, every colorful thing will be change automatically.

But it has some problem with background and text color, they will influent each other. I have no idea how to fix this.

I still considering if I should put WEB PATTERN in this file, or create another file.
